# Okane aka Mr. Money

This is the backend for the world's best spending tracker.

No more awful spreadsheets or shocked expressions when you see your bank account balance.

### Installation Instructions:

1. Run the `okane_postgres_data.sql` and the `okane_postgres_tables.sql` following instructions in the data folder.

- This will create the DB with the Table Schema and populate the mock data.

2. Run `npm run start` to launch the server.

3. Fork the `okane` repo to get access to the front-end.

From,

Mr. Money
